# Enterprise Overview

Focus: reliability, portability, security. Abstract vendor differences while enabling rapid adoption of new models in Rust backends / services.

> Notice: ai-lib PRO enterprise package will be available with configuration-center integrations, key management (KMS/rotation), policy engine (routing/quotas/audit), and observability enhancements (OTLP/redaction/encrypted storage). Contact us for demos and enterprise engagement.

Why Ailib:

- Unified interface reduces integration cost.
- Reliability primitives lower tail latency & error rate.
- Observability roadmap for production governance.
- Vendor neutrality prevents lock-in.
