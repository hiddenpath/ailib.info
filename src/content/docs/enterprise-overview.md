# Enterprise Overview

Focus: reliability, portability, security. Abstract vendor differences while enabling rapid adoption of new models in Rust backends / services.

> **ai-lib-pro Now Available**: Advanced enterprise features including configuration-center integrations, key management (KMS/rotation), policy engine (routing/quotas/audit), and observability enhancements (OTLP/redaction/encrypted storage). [Explore ai-lib-pro features →](/docs/enterprise-pro)

## Market Fit & Value Proposition

### Why choose us?

- **Cost-effectiveness**: A pragmatic middle-ground between “fully DIY” and “buying heavy enterprise gateways (e.g., Kong Enterprise)”. Pay only for what you need; avoid bloat and per‑call fee shocks.
- **Control & Autonomy**: Fully self-hosted deployments for data sovereignty and privacy; customizable to your security/governance needs.
- **Engineering Agility**: Built by engineers for engineers. Shorten procurement cycles, accelerate pilots and scale-out.

### If you are

- **Scaling startups / SMEs**: Past prototype stage; need reliable, observable, high‑performance AI gateway without heavy vendor lock‑in or enterprise licenses.
- **Innovation teams in large enterprises**: Seek agility and autonomy; prefer lightweight, rapidly-iterated solutions over heavyweight procurement.
- **Data‑sensitive organizations**: Require private deployments and fully controlled data paths.

### Our Unique Value (UVP)

- **Rust performance & safety**: High performance, memory safety, modern toolchain.
- **Focused on in‑enterprise AI gateway**: Unified AI APIs, reliability, and governance—without the “do‑everything” bloat of generic gateways.
- **Expert support**: A team that deeply understands multi‑provider AI integration complexity—consulting, tuning, upgrades, and incident response.

### Differentiation vs heavy vendors

- We do not build a “big, generic gateway.” We specialize in AI gateway use cases and multi‑provider unification.
- Engineer‑to‑engineer engagement—rapid iteration; no lengthy sales motions.
- Deep customization around your security, compliance, routing, and governance needs.

### Challenges & how we address them

- **Trust building**: Public technical blogs/case studies, performance benchmarks, and lightweight free code reviews to demonstrate ROI.
- **Competing with large brands**: Differentiate on focus, agility, and developer closeness—not brand size.
- **Scaling services**: First‑class docs/knowledge base and automation to cover 80% of cases; focus on mid/high‑tier customers for quality.
